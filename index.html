            <h2>Navia</h2>
            <p>Judging from her appearance, there's no doubt that Navia is the very picture of a Fontainian lady.
                She likes to accoutre herself in ornate dresses and fine hats, and carries with her a ribboned umbrella encrusted with jewels.
                Thus bedecked, she flits around the streets of the Court of Fontaine, the slopes of Mont Automnequi, as well as lesser-known spots along the Fleuve Cendre. 
                She's never before been hindered by her long flowing dress, nor by her deceptively heavy umbrella. Spry as a sparrow, she is the bearer of glad tidings from the Spina di Rosula for those in need.
                Perhaps this is why Navia has become one of the famous reporter Charlotte's favorite subjects.
                At the exhibition hall of The Steambird, there even hangs a photo connected to her called "The Soaring Yellow Rose."
                But there's no need to worry â€” for it goes without saying that the photo's subject not only consented to its showing, but also gave her enthusiastic support.
